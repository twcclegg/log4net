Prerequisites for log4net tests
===============================

log4net uses NUnit 2.x for its testsuite, the included version is
NUnit 2.6.3.  You can replace it with a more recent version of you
need to.

In addition it is possible to include more libraries when compiling or
running the tests by putting them into a structure that mirrors your
target framework beneath this folder, e.g.

lib\
  net\
    2.0\
      nunit.framework.dll
  mono\
    2.0\
      nunit.framework.dll
    
This should not be necessary to run the tests that are part of
log4net, though.
